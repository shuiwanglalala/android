# 编写异步查询

DAO queries fall into three categories

- *One-shot write* queries that insert, update, or delete data in the database
- *One-shot read* queries that read data from your database only once and return a result with the snapshot of the database at that time
- *Observable read* queries that read data from your database every time the underlying database tables change and emit new values to reflect those changes
